Bugzilla Id: 2052415

Category: Catastrophic/Crash 

Description:
Server crash observed when client opens number of connection and times out. No data is sent.

Step to reproduce:

Specific configuration:
1. Worker threads count 2.
2. No Secure connection required.


Start server( Keep it running ) 
Refer RUN-SIMPLE-SERVER doc in test/scripts directory. (TODO)

Open terminal on Ubuntu VM( or any other distro)
1. Wget the source file from the same directory (restclient.c)
2. Edit SERVER_IP and SERVER_PORT macro in the source file to your server.
3. Compile the downloaded client source (gcc -o restclient restclient.c)
4. Install "parallel" on the Ubuntu distro
5. Run following command
   "seq 0 100 | parallel -j50 ./restclient"


Server will crash. This might take anything between couple of second to 10-15 mins.


ROOT CAUSE:
Bad memory write happened for back pointer reference for timer socket which was already freed.
This was reported by valgrind also.

Fix:
Setting appropiate back pointer to NULL at right place.


Test:
Ran the same test for serveral hours. No crash seen.
Ran under valgrind, no bad write reported.
